## Week 5 - Prac A: Arrays and Lists

### What I Learned

In this practical, I learned how to use arrays and lists in C#. I created a `string[]` array, looped through the values, found the shortest and longest names, sorted the array using `Array.Sort()`, and reversed it using `Array.Reverse()`.

I also learned how to use `List<string>` and methods such as `Add()`, `Remove()`, `Insert()`, and `AddRange()`. I used `IndexOf()` to search for an exact name and `Contains()` to search for part of a name. I also calculated the total length of all names and converted a `string[]` array into a `List<string>` using `ToList()`.

### Array.Sort()

C# uses the `Array.Sort()` method to sort an array. When it is used with strings, the values are sorted in ascending alphabetical order.

### Comparing Arrays and Lists

Arrays use square brackets in their syntax, such as `string[] names`, while lists use generic syntax such as `List<string> names`.

An array has a fixed size after it is created. A list is more flexible because items can be added or removed while the program is running.

Arrays can be useful when the number of values is already known and will not change. Lists are useful when the number of values may change because they provide methods such as `Add()`, `Remove()`, `Insert()`, and `AddRange()`.

Arrays can be slightly simpler and use less overhead when working with a fixed number of values. Lists provide more flexibility and are usually easier to use when the collection needs to grow or shrink.
